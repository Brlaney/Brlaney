## What lead me to learn how to program?

It's January 2020, all is normal in the world (mostly), I had an engineering internship lined up for the summer which had also offered me a job for when I graduate in December. As COVID-19 became a reality for the entire world and the year progressed, I understandably lost that offer. I quickly turned my dissapointment into a drive to improve in and learn a second skillset.

</br>
I had just finished an engineering course that allowed us to use MatLab to impliment something called the *matrix displacement method*. During this course a light switch went off in my head and I started to see the endless value in **loops** to iterate over repetative calculations. I quickly realized the power of programming when I was able to instantly solve a problem that would otherwise take an hour. 
</br>
</br>
This lead me to purchasing the book [Crash Course in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) by [Eric Matthes](https://twitter.com/ehmatthes) and fell in love with python, Django, working with data and APIs and quickly started pushing myself deeper into the wonderful world of computer science.
