## What lead me to learn how to program?

It's January 2020, all is normal in the world (mostly), I had an engineering internship lined up for the summer along with a job offer for when I graduated in December. As COVID-19 progressed, I understandably lost that offer. I quickly turned my dissapointment into a drive to improve in and learn a second skillset.

I had just finished an engineering course that relied heavily on MatLab to impliment something called the *matrix displacement method*. The types of problems we solved in this class were monotonous, repetitive, and were begging to be solved by functions and loops. My first successful MatLab program was a very satisfying experience that took a lot of time to finish. By the end of the semester I started to think more confidently and my mind would start wandering about applying simple programming concepts to things other than my civil engineering course.

This lead me to purchasing the book [Crash Course in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) by [Eric Matthes](https://twitter.com/ehmatthes). This book really got me fired up about programming and helped push me out of my MatLab comfort zone and motivated me to learn how to make killer web-applications.
